# How to run these files
You must have [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/ "FEniCS Project Homepage") installed, and be using python 2.
Run the files as you normally would a python file. The files will output into a folder called "Output", and the output files are .pvd files that can be opened in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/ "ParaView Homepage").
